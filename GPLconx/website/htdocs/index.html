<H1>GPLconx</H1>
<p>This is the home of GPLconx, a tool for visualizing points, lines, circles,
ellipses, hyperbolas, parabolas, and more in three models of
hyperbolic geometry.&nbsp; Hyperbolic geometry is the geometry that results when
you deny Euclid his
fifth postulate, which basically states ``Given a line <i>L</i> and a point <i>P</i> not on <i>L</i>, there exists a unique line containing <i>P</i> that is parallel to <i>L</i>.'' and instead proffer ``Given a line <i>L</i> and a point <i>P</i> not on <i>L</i>, there exist at least two unique lines containing <i>P</i> that are parallel to <i>L</i>.''&nbsp; In geometry, changing an
assumption can lead to a contradiction, and this is very useful as a means
of showing that the assumption is false.&nbsp; If you look for the
contradiction that is implied by the second statement, you will instead
end up proving that Euclidean geometry is exactly as ``true'', as ``correct''
as hyperbolic geometry.
</p>
<p>
The obvious next step after changing an underlying assumption (they go by
the names ``axiom'' and ``postulate'' in geometry) is to explore the resulting
system.&nbsp; For many people, the best way to get geometric intuition, i.e.
a ``feel'' for geometry, is to look at it.&nbsp; GPLconx is a free
(as in ``free speech'' as well as ``free soymilk'') computer program that
lets you see 2-D hyperbolic geometry and manipulate it with your mouse and
a special scripting language.
</p>
<p> GPLconx is currently in an early stage of development.&nbsp; There are
upwards of 23,000 lines of C, C++, and Tcl source code, but the user
experience is still up in the air.&nbsp; In short, that means that you should
not plan a curriculum around
the current user interface (though once GPLconx is mature, it will most likely
be used for no more than a week in a course on geometry).&nbsp; A release is
out, but it's not ready for
the alpha testers, so stay far away and check back here often or subscribe to the mailing list.&nbsp; For now, this page
is not good for much except pointing you to the
<a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gplconx">GPLconx project page</a>
and the <a href="ftp://gplconx.sourceforge.net/pub/gplconx">anonymous FTP site</a>, which has packages that you'll need if you want
to build or hack GPLconx.
</p>
<p>
Here is the <a href="README">README</a> for the latest release of GPLconx.&nbsp; It points to some other documents that are found in the source distribution.
</p>
<p>
Release 0.147's documentation is <a href="GPLconx-0.147-texi2html-monolith.html">here</a>, but don't bother.</p>
<p>
Since GPLconx's documentation is so rough, maybe you should just read Edwin
A. Abbot's <a href="ftp://gplconx.sourceforge.net/pub/gplconx/forBrain/flat10a.txt">
<i>Flatland</i></a> instead.&nbsp; It is here for free thanks to 
<a href="http://promo.net/pg/">Project Gutenberg(TM)</a>.
