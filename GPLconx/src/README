Grep for `DLC' to find things to do.

Tcl/Tk GUI code is in `Tcl/'.

st*.hh and st*.cc are Smalltalkish classes implemented in C++.

*.c and *.h are C functions.

*.cc and *.hh are C++ classes.

Run gconx, tconx, cxxconx, and `tparser 1 2 3' to see what's happening here.

ttalk* enable testing of the Smalltalkish language.

Most of the mathematical magic is found in geomobj* and hypmath*, and most of
the viz/math magic is in dgeomobj* and *canvas* and lines* and gl*.

DLC cxxconx dies, but link with -lefence or use `export MALLOC_CHECK_=2'
and cxxconx does not die!
