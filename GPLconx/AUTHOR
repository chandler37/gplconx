I, David L. Chandler, am the original author and current maintainer.

I wrote GPLconx in an attempt to learn something about visualization,
C programming, Unix, and Makefiles.  The mathematics-related code and
a GLUT GUI was written in the summer of 1996 under the mentorship of
Dr. D. E. "Steve" Stevenson of Clemson University.  I was in a six-week
high school research program at the South Carolina Governor's School for
Science and Mathematics at the time.

GPLconx was my first C program of any consequence, and I'm afraid that
you can tell by looking at the old source code.  It has since been
rewritten in C++ and will again be rewritten in Java.  It may even be
ported to PalmOS one of these days.
