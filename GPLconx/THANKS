GPLconx is what it is thanks to the following:

Dr. D. E. "Steve" Stevenson, Associate Professor of Computer Science
at Clemson University.  He mentored me, David L. Chandler, in the
geometry, the numerics, the visualization, and the C language itself.

Spencer Kimball and Peter Mattis for The GIMP, from which HSV support
is stolen.

Jens Reimann <ctron@dentrassi.de> and Rik Hemsley <rik@kde.org>,
authors of the Linux Class Library.
