This is GPLconx's copy of Togl, an edited version of Togl-1.6, and it is
not the official release of Togl.  Togl can be found at
`http://togl.sourceforge.net'.

If you are using a version of Tk that is not supported, then you will get
a compile error.  You'll then have to point `togl.c' to the `tkInt.h' file
from your version of Tk.  Tk can be found at
`http://tktoolkit.sourceforge.net'.  Your `tkInt.h'
may use `#include' to include other files, and you should copy all of them
to this directory along with `tkInt.h'.  You should then edit togl.c
and replace the `#  error  Sorry, ...' with `#include "tkInt.h"'.

See the file `LICENSE' in this directory for information on using Togl.
